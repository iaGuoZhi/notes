# make(1)

## Anatomy of `make` rules
```make
target .. : prerequisite ..
	recipe
	..
```

- `target`: an output generated by the rule
- `prerequisite`: an input that is used to generate the target
- `recipe`: list of actions to generate the output from the input

> Use `make -p` to print all rules and variables (implicitly + explicitly defined).

## Pattern rules & Automatic variables
### Pattern rules
A pattern rule contains the `%` char (exactly one of them) and look like this example:
```make
%.o : %.c
	$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@
```
The target matches files of the pattern `%.o`, where `%` matches any none-empty
substring and other character match just them self.

The substring matched by `%` is called the `stem`.

`%` in the prerequisite stands for the matched `stem` in the target.

### Automatic variables
As targets and prerequisites in pattern rules can't be spelled explicitly in
the recipe, make provides a set of automatic variables to work with:
- `$@`: Name of the target that triggered the rule.
- `$<`: Name of the first prerequisite.
- `$^`: Names of all prerequisites (without duplicates).
- `$+`: Names of all prerequisites (with duplicates).
- `$*`: Stem of the pattern rule.

```make
# file: Makefile

all: foobar blabla

foo% bla%: aaa bbb bbb
	@echo "@ = $@"
	@echo "< = $<"
	@echo "^ = $^"
	@echo "+ = $+"
	@echo "* = $*"
	@echo "----"

aaa:
bbb:
```

Running above `Makefile` gives:
```text
@ = foobar
< = aaa
^ = aaa bbb
+ = aaa bbb bbb
* = bar
----
@ = blabla
< = aaa
^ = aaa bbb
+ = aaa bbb bbb
* = bla
----
```

Variables related to filesystem paths:
- `$(CURDIR)`: Path of current working dir after using `make -C path`

## Arguments

Arguments specified on the command line *override* ordinary variable
assignments in the makefile ([overriding variables][make-var-override]).

```make
VAR = abc
all:
	@echo VAR=$(VAR)
```

```text
# make
VAR=abc

# make VAR=123
VAR=123
```

## Useful functions

### Substitution references
Substitute strings matching pattern in a list.
```make
in  := a.o l.a c.o
out := $(in:.o=.c)
# => out = a.c l.a c.c
```

### `filter`
Keep strings matching a pattern in a list.
```make
in  := a.a b.b c.c d.d
out := $(filter %.b %.c, $(in))
# => out = b.b c.c
```

### `filter-out`
Remove strings matching a pattern from a list.
```make
in  := a.a b.b c.c d.d
out := $(filter-out %.b %.c, $(in))
# => out = a.a d.d
```

### `abspath`
Resolve each file name as absolute path (don't resolve symlinks).
```make
$(abspath fname1 fname2 ..)

### `realpath`
Resolve each file name as canonical path.
```make
$(realpath fname1 fname2 ..)
```
